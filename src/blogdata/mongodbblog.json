Unlike traditional relational databases that use tables and rows, MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents (called <strong>BSON<\/strong> in MongoDB), which makes it highly scalable and suitable for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.\r\n        <\/p>\r\n\r\n        <h2>Key Features of MongoDB:<\/h2>\r\n        <ul>\r\n            <li><strong>Document-Based:<\/strong> Data is stored in flexible documents (BSON) instead of rigid tables.<\/li>\r\n            <li><strong>Schema-less:<\/strong> Collections do not require a predefined structure, allowing flexibility in the data schema.<\/li>\r\n            <li><strong>Scalability:<\/strong> MongoDB is built for horizontal scaling, making it ideal for applications that need to handle large amounts of data and traffic.<\/li>\r\n            <li><strong>Indexing:<\/strong> Supports indexing to improve query performance.<\/li>\r\n            <li><strong>Replication & Sharding:<\/strong> MongoDB supports replication (for high availability) and sharding (for horizontal scaling).<\/li>\r\n            <li><strong>Aggregation Framework:<\/strong> Allows data transformation and processing similar to SQL's GROUP BY and JOIN operations.<\/li>\r\n            <li><strong>High Performance:<\/strong> Optimized for both read and write operations at scale.<\/li>\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n        <h2>Use Cases:<\/h2>\r\n        <ul>\r\n            <li>Big Data Applications<\/li>\r\n            <li>Real-time Analytics<\/li>\r\n            <li>Content Management Systems (CMS)<\/li>\r\n            <li>Internet of Things (IoT) applications<\/li>\r\n        <\/ul>\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n            MongoDB is popular for applications requiring fast development cycles, scalability, and flexible data models.\r\n        <\/p>\r\n    <\/div>\r\n<\/body>\r\n<\/html>\r\n",
